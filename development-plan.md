# The Good Stuff Campfire - Development Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step approach for developing the campfire scene using the existing Three.js ocean simulation as a foundation.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Understanding (Day 1)

### Steps:
1. **Clone Ocean Repository**
   - Copy all files to new project folder
   - Ensure all dependencies are included
   - Verify the basic ocean scene runs correctly

2. **Understand Existing Systems**
   - Review ocean implementation (Ocean.js)
   - Study sky and day/night cycle (Skybox.js)
   - Analyze material system (SkyboxMaterial.js, OceanMaterial.js)
   - Understand time management (Time.js)

3. **Plan Integration Points**
   - Identify where to add new scene elements
   - Determine how to integrate with existing lighting
   - Plan file structure for new components

### Deliverables:
- Working base project with ocean and sky
- Documented understanding of key systems
- Updated project structure with placeholders for new files

## Phase 2: Beach Creation (Day 2)

### Steps:
1. **Create Beach Terrain**
   - Implement basic geometry for beach area
   - Position relative to ocean
   - Apply appropriate textures

2. **Connect Beach to Ocean**
   - Ensure proper transition between beach and water
   - Adjust height mappings for natural appearance
   - Handle intersections cleanly

3. **Test Beach Integration**
   - Verify beach works with ocean movement
   - Check textures and materials under different lighting
   - Ensure performance remains good

### Deliverables:
- Beach.js implementation
- Beach materials and textures
- Working beach-ocean integration

## Phase 3: Campfire Implementation (Day 3)

### Steps:
1. **Create Basic Campfire**
   - Build log arrangement using cylinders
   - Add stone circle around logs
   - Implement basic fire geometry

2. **Implement Fire Animation**
   - Create vertex animation for flames
   - Add color variations for realistic fire
   - Implement optional particle effects for embers

3. **Add Fire Lighting**
   - Create point light for fire illumination
   - Implement flickering effect
   - Test integration with day/night cycle

### Deliverables:
- Campfire.js implementation
- Fire animation system
- Dynamic lighting effects

## Phase 4: Character Creation (Day 4)

### Steps:
1. **Design Characters**
   - Create low-poly character models
   - Implement seated pose
   - Apply simple materials and colors

2. **Position Characters**
   - Place around campfire in natural positions
   - Orient to face each other
   - Set proper scale relative to environment

3. **Add Character Props**
   - Create marshmallow stick for first character
   - Create poking stick for second character
   - Add any other character-specific details

### Deliverables:
- Characters.js implementation
- Two distinct character models
- Characters positioned in scene

## Phase 5: Animation Implementation (Day 5)

### Steps:
1. **Implement Idle Animations**
   - Add subtle breathing movement
   - Create occasional head turning
   - Implement small position adjustments

2. **Create Interaction Animations**
   - Develop marshmallow roasting animation
   - Create fire-poking animation
   - Add timing system for occasional animations

3. **Test Animation Integration**
   - Verify animations work with scene timing
   - Check for any clipping or issues
   - Ensure animations look natural

### Deliverables:
- Animation systems for characters
- Specialized animations for interactions
- Animation timing and triggering system

## Phase 6: Environmental Details (Day 6)

### Steps:
1. **Add Vegetation**
   - Create palm tree models
   - Add beach grass or plants
   - Position vegetation appropriately

2. **Add Beach Details**
   - Scatter rocks of various sizes
   - Add seashells and driftwood
   - Create any other beach props

3. **Enhance Environment**
   - Add subtle ambient animations (swaying trees)
   - Implement environmental sounds (optional)
   - Refine overall composition

### Deliverables:
- Props.js implementation
- Environmental details and objects
- Enhanced scene composition

## Phase 7: Lighting and Visual Enhancement (Day 7)

### Steps:
1. **Refine Lighting**
   - Fine-tune fire light properties
   - Enhance interaction between fire light and day/night cycle
   - Add subtle ambient lighting if needed

2. **Visual Improvements**
   - Enhance material properties
   - Add subtle post-processing effects if performance allows
   - Improve shadow quality where important

3. **Optimize Performance**
   - Identify and fix any performance bottlenecks
   - Reduce draw calls where possible
   - Ensure stable frame rate

### Deliverables:
- Optimized lighting system
- Enhanced visual quality
- Performance improvements

## Phase 8: Camera and Final Polish (Day 8)

### Steps:
1. **Set Up Camera**
   - Position camera for ideal view
   - Implement subtle camera movement if desired
   - Ensure good framing for video background use

2. **Final Integration**
