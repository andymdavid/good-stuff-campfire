# The Good Stuff Campfire - Background Ocean Scene

This is a simplified Three.js ocean scene that serves as a beautiful background for video content. The scene focuses on rendering a realistic ocean with day/night cycle.

## Features

- Realistic ocean surface with waves and reflections
- Dynamic sky with day/night cycle
- Simple camera controls (mousewheel to zoom in/out)
- Optimized for use as video background

## Technical Details

The scene has been simplified to include only the essential components:

- Ocean rendering with surface and volume
- Sky system with day/night cycle and stars
- Minimal camera system with zoom control
- No game mechanics or complex interactions

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. The scene will automatically render with the ocean and sky
3. Use the mousewheel to zoom in/out if needed
4. The day/night cycle will progress automatically

This project is designed to serve as a background for a campfire scene with two characters.
